### Summer Placement Project @ Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton

*Last update: 15/10/14 (sd15)*

This repository centralizes the various small codechunks of my Summer Placement Project @ Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton. The purpose of this project is to explore the possibilities to wrap up different alignment programs / pipelines in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, either for production in closed environments or as Illumina BaseSpace Native Apps. Please refer to the preliminary [slides](IGM-talk_docker-pipelines.pdf) of my talk at the Sanger Informatics Group Meeting for more fancy illustrations.
