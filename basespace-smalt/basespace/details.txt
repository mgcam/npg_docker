# Short Description
SMALT aligns DNA sequencing reads with a reference genome.

# Long Description
This smalt pipeline performs the smalt alignment and post-processing (stats, flagstats, mark duplicates) of the resulting bam file. The metrics will be displayed in the report.

The smalt aligner employs a hash index of short words of up to 20
nucleotides sampled at equidistant steps along the reference genome.
For each sequencing read, potentially matching segments in the
reference genome are identified from seed matches in the index and
subsequently aligned with the read using dynamic programming.
